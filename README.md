[Documentation](https://shiny.rstudio.com/py/docs/shinylive.html)

This repository contains a Python package for deploying Shinylive applications.

Please note that this is not the same as the https://github.com/rstudio/shinylive repository. That repository is used to generate the Shinylive assets distribution, which is a bundle containing HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and wasm files. The Python package in this repository downloads the assets and uses them to create Shinylive application deployments.
